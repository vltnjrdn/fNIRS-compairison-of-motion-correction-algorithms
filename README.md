# fNIRS-compairison-of-motion-correction-algorithms

## - 4 scripts:
### 2 scripts analyze the whole dataset, 2 of them only a user-defined time window and channel (_time_channel), 2 of them with and 2 of them without SSR (_SSR)
## - 2 dataset (RLOESS.mat and RLOESS_SSR.mat)
### I saved them because the algorithm took too long
## - 1 function (compute_PSD_oxyHb)
